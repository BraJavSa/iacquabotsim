# IAcquaBot Sim

**IAcquaBot Sim** is an open-access simulation platform for surface robotic vehicles.  
It enables researchers and engineers to develop, test, and validate motion control strategies  
under realistic marine conditions using a customizable USV model and sensor suite.

This repository is a **fork of [Virtual RobotX (VRX)](https://github.com/osrf/vrx)**,  
extended with a new monohull surface vehicle inspired by **IAcquaBot**, a real-world robot  
developed at the **National University of San Juan (Argentina)**.

## Controllers

The simulation framework includes a set of model-based motion controllers  
implemented using an identified dynamic model of the vehicle.  
The model structure follows a standard 3-DOF surface vessel formulation  
as proposed by Fossen for marine vehicle dynamics.

Available controllers include:

- **Velocity Controller**: Regulates surge and yaw velocities via low-level feedback.  
- **Point-to-Point Navigation**: Drives the vehicle to discrete goal positions using kinematic guidance.  
- **Path Following Controller**: Tracks geometric paths defined in Cartesian space.  
- **Trajectory Tracking Controller**: Follows time-parametrized reference trajectories with full-state feedback.
