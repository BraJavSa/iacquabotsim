# IAcquaBot Sim

**IAcquaBot Sim** is an open-access simulation platform for surface robotic vehicles.  
It enables researchers and engineers to develop, test, and validate motion control strategies  
under realistic marine conditions using a customizable USV model and sensor suite.

This repository is a **fork of [Virtual RobotX (VRX)](https://github.com/osrf/vrx)**,  
extended with a new monohull surface vehicle inspired by **IAcquaBot**, a real-world robot  
developed at the **National University of San Juan (Argentina)**.
